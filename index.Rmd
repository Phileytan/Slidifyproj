## Slide with Plot 
### from ggplot2 package


Here is a plot from USmortality dataset.
I used ggplot2 package : 

```{r plot, echo=FALSE}
sex=c("Male", "Female")
status=c("Urban", "Rural")

data <- USMortality[(USMortality$Sex %in% sex) & (USMortality$Status %in% status),]

ggplot(data, aes(Rate, Cause)) +
          facet_grid(.~data$Sex+data$Status) +
          geom_point()
```

You need an internet connection as the application is on shinyapps.io

You could therefore interactively modify the graph I plot on the previous slide :
